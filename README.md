# Natural Scene Classification using CNN and Transfer learning

In this research, the intel dataset used comprises of images categorized into six classes: 
Building, Sea, Forest, Glacier, Street, and Mountain. The training set consists of 14,000 images, 
while the test set contains 3,000 images. A customized CNN model, alongside three pre-trained 
models (VGG16, ResNet50, and Inception V3), will be used to classify the image categories. 
Following training using these various models, the metrics of accuracy, recall, and precision 
will be utilized to evaluate and compare the performance of each model. The goal of the 
research is to classify scene images to one of the predefined scene categories (Building, Sea, 
Forest, Glacier, Street, and Mountain) so as to contribute to the development of scene 
recognition models thereby advancing the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence system to be 
able to understand outdoor visual content. The expected outcome of this research is to identify 
the most suitable deep learning architecture for scene recognition tasks.

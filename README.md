# Natural Scene Classification using CNN and Transfer learning

In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), one of the most significant 
advancements has been the ability of machines to understand and interpret visual data . Image 
classification has emerged as a strong research area in computer vision over recent years, 
forming the foundation for different visual recognition applications (Chen et al., 2021).. 
Scene recognition is essential for machines to comprehend their environment, enabling them 
to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions. This technology holds great promise 
in various domains, such as aiding visually impaired individuals, enhancing surveillance 
systems, and augmenting virtual and reality experiences (Shabbir et al., 2021). In scene 
recognition, objects are identified based on their arrangement within the image and the context 
of the background, as opposed to object classification, which primarily focuses on categorizing 
prominent objects in the foreground (Soudy et al., 2022). Natural scene classification has 
remained an active area of research for several years and it is very important because it has a
diverse range of applications such as robot navigation, disaster detection, content-based image 
retrieval and intelligent surveillance (Zeng et al., 2021). 
In this research, the intel dataset used comprises of images categorized into six classes: 
Building, Sea, Forest, Glacier, Street, and Mountain. The training set consists of 14,000 images, 
while the test set contains 3,000 images. A customized CNN model, alongside three pre-trained 
models (VGG16, ResNet50, and Inception V3), will be used to classify the image categories. 
Following training using these various models, the metrics of accuracy, recall, and precision 
will be utilized to evaluate and compare the performance of each model. The goal of the 
research is to classify scene images to one of the predefined scene categories (Building, Sea, 
Forest, Glacier, Street, and Mountain) so as to contribute to the development of scene 
recognition models thereby advancing the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence system to be 
able to understand outdoor visual content. The expected outcome of this research is to identify 
the most suitable deep learning architecture for scene recognition tasks.
